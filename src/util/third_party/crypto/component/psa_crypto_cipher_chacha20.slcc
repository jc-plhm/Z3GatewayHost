label: PSA Crypto support for Chacha20
description: >-
  This component provides support for the ChaCha20 stream cipher in the
  PSA Crypto cipher APIs. Hardware acceleration of ChaCha20 is only supported
  on Vault High devices and only for one-shot Chacha20, that is multi-part cipher
  APIs are not supported with ChaCha20. Hence if the user needs multi-part
  ChaCha20 cipher streaming he will need to apply the
  'Mbed TLS Support for ChaChaPoly' component in order to include fallback
  to the software implementation in the Mbed TLS library.
