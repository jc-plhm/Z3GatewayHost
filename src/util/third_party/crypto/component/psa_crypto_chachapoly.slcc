label: PSA Crypto support for ChachaPoly
description: >-
  This component provides support for authenticated encryption and decryption
  with ChaChaPoly in the PSA Crypto AEAD APIs.
  The hardware acceleration of ChaChaPoly is only supported on Vault High devices.
  However the special case where both the message and additional data length
  are zero is not supported. Hence if the user needs zero data lengths he will
  need to apply the 'Mbed TLS Support for ChaChaPoly' component in order to
  include fallback to the software implementation in the Mbed TLS library.

  NOTE: This component does not suppport Chacha20 in the PSA cipher APIs.
  In order to support Chacha20 cipher as a standalone stream cipher, the user
  must include 'PSA Crypto support for Chacha20'.
