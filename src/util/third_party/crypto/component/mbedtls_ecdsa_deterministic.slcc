label: Mbed TLS Support for deterministic ECDSA
description: >-
  This component provides support for signature generation and verification with
  ECDSA using Mbed TLS. The primary purpose of this component is to enable the
  software fallback implementation of deterministic ECDSA in PSA Crypto.

  WARNING: Adding support for deterministic ECDSA through Mbed TLS will preclude
  regular ECDSA operations using the Mbed TLS API from being accelerated on Series-2
  devices. ECDSA operations on those devices using the corresponding PSA API are
  unaffected.
