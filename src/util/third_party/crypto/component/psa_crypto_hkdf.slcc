label: PSA Crypto support for HKDF
description: >-
  This component provides support for key derivation using HKDF in PSA Crypto.
  Hardware acceleration of HKDF is only supported on Vault High devices and
  only for opaque keys but cannot operate standalone (currently). Therefore
  the builtin HKDF implementation of PSA Crypto is applied on all devices.
