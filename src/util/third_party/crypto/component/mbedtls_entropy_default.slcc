label: Mbed TLS Support for Default Hardware Entropy Source
description: >-
  This component provides support for using entropy gathered from an
  entropy source present on Silicon Labs devices. Depending on the device's
  capabilities, this can be either a hardware (TRNG, Radio or ADC) source, or a
  device-unique seed in non-volatile storage.
