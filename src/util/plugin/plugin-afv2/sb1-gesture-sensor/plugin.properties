description=This code will act as a driver for an EFM8SB1 Gesture sensor.  It requires a callback (usually an irq's ISR) to be defined as the SB1_ISR macro in board.h.  It will implement the gestureReceived callback, which will deliver an enumerated gesture type (as defined in sb1-gesture-sensor.h) whenever a gesture is received.
