/** @brief EZSP Error Handler
 *
 * This callback is fired when the host process receives an error from the EZSP
 * link when talking to the NCP. The return boolean gives the user application
 * the option to reboot the NCP. If this function returns true, the NCP will be
 * rebooted and the connection between the host and NCP will drop. If not, the
 * NCP will continue operating.
 *
 * @param status The EzspStatus error code received.
 *
 * @return bool True to reset NCP, false not to.
 *
 * @note This callback is only fired on the host application. It has no use for
 * SoC or NCP applications.
