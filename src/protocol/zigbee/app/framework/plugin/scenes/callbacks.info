/** @brief Scenes Server Custom Recall Scene
 *
 * Customize the implementation of the Scenes cluster RecallScene command
 * for desired behavior when gradually transitioning to the specified scene
 * over the specified transition time interval.
 *
 * Upon entry to this callback, the presented scene table entry has been verified
 * to be valid for the endpoint, group ID, and scene ID referenced in the received
 * ZCL Scenes cluster RecallScene command.
 *
 * NOTE: If this callback is implemented, the expectation is that it will INITIATE
 * the scene transition behavior and return promptly with prospective success or
 * failure status, rather than execute through the full duration of the transition
 * time before returning.
 *
 * NOTE: The scene table entry pointer, and the information in the scene
 * table entry, are available only during the execution of this callback
 * function. The scene table entry information (NOT the pointer) must be copied
 * and saved before returning from this callback function if it will need to be
 * referenced at other times to perform the desired transition behavior
 * (for example, by a timer-based periodic handler launched by this callback).
 *
 * If the value of transitionTimeDs is 0xFFFF, the transition time information
 * configured in the scene table entry should be used.
 *
 * Upon arriving at the target scene configuration, the custom implementation
 * should set the Scenes cluster attributes CurrentScene and CurrentGroup to
 * the scene ID and group ID values contained in the sceneEntry, and set the
 * SceneValid attribute to true.
 *
 * Returns true if a customization of this callback HAS been IMPLEMENTED.
 * This REQUIRES that a valid ::EmberAfStatus value has been written to the status
 * argument. Status will be ::EMBER_ZCL_STATUS_SUCCESS if the scene transition has
 * been initiated successfully, even though the transition time has not fully elapsed
 * and the full effect of the scene transition over the transition time has not
 * yet completed. Otherwise, a suitable error status value should be returned
 * in the status argument.
 *
 * Returns false if a customization of this callback HAS NOT been implemented.
 * In this case, the Scenes plugin will perform default handling (apply target
 * scene settings immediately without regard for the specified transition time).
 *
